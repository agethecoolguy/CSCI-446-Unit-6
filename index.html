			<p class="justify">French Club at CSM is a group of students that are French, French-speaking, or generally interested in French culture and shenanigans! Founded by Adrien Perinet and Ian Tobiason in 2017, neither of them thought this would become an actual club on campus. They hosted meetings in empty classrooms and their house until they received recognition from Colorado School of Mines as an authentic campus activity.</p>
			<p class="justify">French Club now boasts a membership of over 10 and continues to grow. Some activities they host include French movies, French potlucks, French wine tasting, crepe making, and anything else the group decides could be fun!</p>
			<p class="justify small">NOTE: French club condones drinking only in moderation. 21 means 21.</p>
